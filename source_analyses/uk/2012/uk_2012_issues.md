# Main issues with the UK 2012 dataset

- (CHP) An overview of installed capacities is required to validate the technology share and full load hours.

- (PP&HP) Dashboard assumptions should be researched based on an overview of installed capacities to validate the technology share and full load hours.

- (Primary Production) Dashboard assumptions should be researched.

- (Primary Production) Timecurves should be researched.

- (Residences) Technology split in space heating, hot water and cooling should be researched

- (Residences) Data on cooling is missing. According to JB this is probably reported in the applicances section in the ECUK data.

- (Residences) Data on vacuum cleaners is missing.

- (Residences) Old/new residences split should be researched.

- (Services) Technology split for space heating and cooling should be researched.

- (Services) Technology split for lighting should be checked. (Is this useful demand or final demand. JB assumed final demand.)

- (Agriculture) Not done yet.

- (Area) Reasonable quality. Various parameters can be updated.
