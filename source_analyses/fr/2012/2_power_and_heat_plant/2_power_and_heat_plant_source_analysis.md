# 2. Power and heat plant analysis

The dashboard assumption for the first attempt were obtained from the NL 2011 dataset. 


The following changes were made:

- The shares of coal plants, gas plants and nuclear plants were optimized to reduce the error in fuel input. Generally shifting toward lower efficiency technologies compared to the NL 2011 dataset.


Issues:

- (Fossil) Production shares of coal plants, gas plants and nuclear plants need to be researched.
- (Hydro) Production shares of hydro plants need to be researched
- (Solar) Production shares of solar plants need to be researched
- (Wind) Production shares of wind turbines need to be researched.
- (FLH) Full load hours need to be researched based on installed capacities.
