# Main issues with the FR 2012 dataset

- (CHP) In general the calculated fuel input for electricity and sold heat production and the calculated sold heat production is lower than the reported fuel input and reported sold heat production.

- (CHP) An overview of installed capacities is required to validate the technology share and full load hours.

- (PP&HP) Dashboard assumptions should be researched based on an overview of installed capacities to validate the technology share and full load hours.

- (Primary Production) Dashboard assumptions should be researched.

- (Primary Production) Timecurves should be researched.

- (Chemical) Negative final demand for woodpellets.

- (Residences) The application split (final demand) and technology shares need to be researched.

- (Services) The application split (final demand) and technology shares need to be researched.

- (Agriculture) Not done yet.

- (Area) Rough assumption is made for some constants. Extensive research is required.
