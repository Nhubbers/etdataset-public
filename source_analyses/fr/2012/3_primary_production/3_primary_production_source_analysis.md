# 3. Primary production analysis

The dashboard assumptions for the first attempt were obtained from the NL 2011 dataset. The timecurves are based on data from the Primes reference scenario, see the `3_primary_production_source_analysis.xlsm` for more details.


Issues:

- Max production of waste carriers is lower than the actual production of waste carriers. The max production need to be adapted and a check is required to avoid this issue in the future.
