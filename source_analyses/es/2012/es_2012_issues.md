# Main issues with the ES 2012 dataset

- PV shift is required!

- Whole dataset should be researched.

- (CHP) The CHP analysis requires more attention. Currently, there are large % diffrences in the results by fuel.

- (CHP) An overview of installed capacities is required to validate the technology share and full load hours.

- (PP&HP) An overview of installed capacities is required to validate the technology share and full load hours.

- (Primary Production) Dashboard assumptions should be researched.

- (Primary Production) Timecurves should be researched.

- (Metal) [CRITICAL] The final demand of natural gas in the other industry sector is below zero. Might be result from the usage of other fuels in the metal industry.

- (Residences) The application split (final demand) and technology shares requires research.

- (Services) The application split (final demand) and technology shares requires research.

- (Transport) The application split (final demand) and technology shares requires research.

- (Area) Country specific constants requires research.

- (Merit) Demand profiles are required for all countries.
