# 6. Residences analysis

The dashboard assumptions for the first attempt were obtained from the DE 2011 dataset.


The following changes were made:

- The final demand for space heating, hot water, lighting, cooking and appliances are estimated roughly based on the Odyssee 2011 data. The 2011 values are scaled to the final demand in 2012 taken from the IEA energy balance.
- A first attempt is made to fit the final demand, space heating, hot water and cooking assumptions to the energy balance data. Estimated roughly based on Odyssee 2011 data and subsequently optimized to reduce relative errors in fuel consumption.


Issues:

- The application split (final demand) and technology shares need to be researched.
