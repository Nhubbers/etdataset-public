# 3. Primary production analysis

The dashboard assumptions for the first attempt were obtained from the DE 2011 dataset. The timecurves are based on data from the Primes reference scenario, see the `3_primary_production_source_analysis.xlsm` for more details.


Issues:

- Dashboard assumptions should be researched.
- Timecurves should be researched.
