# 2. Power and heat plant analysis

The dashboard assumption for the first attempt were obtained from the NL 2011 dataset. 

## Hydro

The share between hydro river and hydro mountain are estimated based on the installed capacities researched by Ecofys. The full load hours (FLH) are subsequently calculated using the installed capacities and the electricity production.

| Technology | Installed capacity (MW) | Share | FLH (h) |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| River | 37 | 100.0% | 2,808 |
| Mountain | 0 | 0.0% | 4,492 |
