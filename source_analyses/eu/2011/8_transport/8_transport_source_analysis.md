# 8. Transport analysis

There are only four inputs to make into the transport analysis dashboard:

1. Trucks do not drive on gasoline
* Diesel consumption by cars vs trucks: This share is taken from the NL dataset (56% of diesel used in cars and trucks is consumed in cars, 44% in trucks). Research is required for the EU.
* Trucks do not drive on electricity.
* Trucks do not drive on compressed gas.
