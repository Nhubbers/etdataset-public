# 3. Primary production analysis

The dashboard assumptions for the first attempt were obtained from the DE 2011 dataset. The timecurves are based on data from the Primes reference scenario, see the `3_primary_production_source_analysis.xlsm` for more details.


The following changes were made:

- The max biogenic and non-biogenic waste production are both set to 50 PJ.


Potential sources:

- GUS (2012) Municipal infrastructure in 2011 (xls)
  * Municipal waste management (Table 25); share between recycling, treated and deposited waste.
- GUS (2013) Environment 2013
  * Processed vs deposited waste (p. 354)


Issues:

- Max biogenic and non-biogenic waste production need to be researched.
