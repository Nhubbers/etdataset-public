# Main issues with the PL 2012 dataset

- PV shift might be required!

- (CHP) CHPs are very important in Poland and requires therefore a lot of attention. An overview of installed capacities is required to validate the technology share and full load hours.

- (PP&HP) Dashboard assumptions should be researched based on an overview of installed capacities to validate the technology share and full load hours.

- (Primary Production) Dashboard assumptions should be researched.

- (Primary Production) Timecurves need to be validated, e.g. based on PRIMES data.

- (Metal) There is a lot of unmodelled coal transformation in the metal sector. This is cause by an 'overproduction' of cokes. (Transformation output of cokes ovens is appr. 250 PJ, where the final demand is only appr. 27 PJ.)

- (Chemical) Negative final demand for woodpellets. Most likely cause by allocation in CHP analysis. See also [ETdataset#175](https://github.com/quintel/etdataset/issues/175).

- (Residences) The technology shares need to be researched.

- (Services) The application split (final demand) and technology shares need to be researched.

- (Agriculture) Not done yet.

- (Area) Rough assumption is made for some constants. Extensive research is required.
