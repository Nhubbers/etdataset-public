# 11. Area analysis


The following changes were made:

- Areable land, coast line, land available for solar, number of inhabitants, offshore suitable for wind, onshore suitable for wind, number of buildings, number of residences, residences roof surface available for pv, buildings roof surface available for pv, co2 emissions 1990 were obtained from various sources.


## Roof surface available for PV

The total roof surface available for PV is 395 km2 according to Ecofys analysis. It is assumed that 2/3 is on residences and 1/3 on buildings.

| Location                                 | Area (km2) |
| :--------------------------------------- | ---------: |
| residences_roof_surface_available_for_PV |       263  |
| buildings_roof_surface_available_for_PV  |       132  |


## Debts

- More research and validation is required.
- Offshore wind potential requires more research.
- Capacity credit parameters need to be updated.
