# 7. Services analysis

The dashboard assumptions for the first attempt were obtained from the DE 2011 dataset.

The following changes were made:

- A first estimation of the final demand is made proportional to the application split in the DE 2011 dataset.
- Reduce technology share of oil-fired heaters in space heating to 10%, increase the share of coal-fired heaters to 20% and adapt the share of gas-fired heaters to make it 100% to avoid negative oil demand and negative gas demand in other appliances.

Issues:

- The application split (final demand) and technology shares need to be researched. The Odyssee data provides to little information.
- Demand for other carriers is appr. 700 TJ. This energy use is not accounted for in the ETM.
