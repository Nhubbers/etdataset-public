## area data

The area data are now created in the 'area_analysis' research analysis. This is still being developed. See for example [Github issue 373](https://github.com/quintel/etdataset/issues/373).

For the time being, the de.ad is made up of 'old' numbers that were probably researched by Mark den Heijer. 

### Required improvements

We need justification of the following topics that are part of the de.ad

- population
- infrastructure cost for electricity and gas grid
- available and areable land, lenght of coast
- roof areas, land areas for solar PV and wind
- insulation data for buildings and old/new residences
- CO2 emissions figures and costs
- employment information
- el. export capacity
- car and truck km
