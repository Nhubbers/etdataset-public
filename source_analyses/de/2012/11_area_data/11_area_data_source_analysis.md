# 11. Area analysis

The dashboard assumptions for the first attempt were obtained from the DE 2011 dataset.


The following changes were made:

- Areable land, coast line, land available for solar, number of inhabitants, onshore suitable for wind, number of buildings, number of residences, residences roof surface available for pv, buildings roof surface available for pv, co2 emissions 1990, capacity credit wind constants were obtained from various sources.

- See [11_area_source_analysis.xlsx](11_area_source_analysis.xlsx) for more information about the capacity credit.


## Roof surface available for PV

The total roof surface available for PV is 842 km2 according to Ecofys analysis. It is assumed that 2/3 is on residences and 1/3 on buildings.

| Location                                 | Area (km2) |
| :--------------------------------------- | ---------: |
| residences_roof_surface_available_for_PV |       561  |
| buildings_roof_surface_available_for_PV  |       281  |


## Debts

- More research and validation is required.
- Offshore wind potential requires more research.
